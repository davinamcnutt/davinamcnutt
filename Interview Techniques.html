    <ul>
      <li>Firstly if you can prepare a location for your interview that is well lit and away from noise, then that would be a great first step. You, your family and future generations will want to see their relatives well and hear very clearly the privledged insight into their lives that they are giving you. </li>
      <li> You can have a family member record the interview on their phone in the comfort of your own home or hire a professional video crew. The choice is up to you. I used a Sony EX1 for some of my family interviews but found my Flip video pocket camera so much handier and very good HD quality.</li>
      <li>Try to relax and be yourself, as much as you can when being recorded. The whole idea is to capture the real you, so that future generations that never got the pleasure of meeting you can feel like they are meeting you now. </li>
      <li> Be prepared, look over the questionaires and find those questions that are right for you. Try to remember any funny events from your life. Your family seeing you laugh and getting to know you will be priceless. </li>
      <li>Do a little soul searching yourself and figure out what you would like your decendants to know about you. </li>
      <li>Take your time. There is no need to do your interview all at once. If you prefer you can do it at your own pace. </li>
      <li>You can also update your interviews as often as you would like, keeping eveyone up to date. You can add updates yearly but try to add another personal interview every decade at least.</li>
      <li>Get someone to ask you questions if that helps or just talk freely. It's entirely what suits you best and what gives the best interview. </li>
      <li>If you would like your interview to have a professional touchand a documentary feel, then these links might help you with camera and lighting set-ups, positioning your interviewee and directing them where to look and having leading space in the direction your interviewee is looking. </li>
